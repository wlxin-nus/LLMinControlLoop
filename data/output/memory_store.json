Your task is to devise the optimal control strategy based on the provided context.\n\nYou will receive input that contains the building's current state, the user's high-level goals, and feedback on your last action.\n\nYou MUST follow these rules strictly:\n1.  First, reason step-by-step about the current situation. Critically analyze the **feedback on your last action**. A positive reward is good; a negative reward is bad and indicates your strategy needs correction. Consider all available data to form your plan.\n2.  Wrap this reasoning process within `<think>` and `</think>` tags.\n3.  After your reasoning, provide a single, definitive control action. This action MUST be a valid JSON object. Wrap this JSON object within `<action>` and `</action>` tags.\n4.  The JSON keys in your action must exactly match the names of the controllable variables (e.g., \"con_oveTSetCoo_u\").\n5.  The JSON values must be within the specified min/max range for that variable.\n\n**EXAMPLE OF YOUR REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:**\n\nThis example shows how your final response should be structured. The reasoning inside `<think>` should reflect the actual data provided to you.\n\n```xml\n<think>\nBased on the current indoor temperature of 298K which is slightly high, and the user's demand for energy saving, I should lower the cooling setpoint, but not too aggressively. The previous setpoint was 295K. My last action yielded a small positive reward, which means the direction was correct. I will continue this trend. A small adjustment to 294.15K seems reasonable. This is a 0.85K decrease, which should gently cool the space without a major energy spike. The value 294.15 is well within the allowed range of 278.15K to 308.15K.\n</think>\n<action>\n{\n  \"con_oveTSetCoo_u\": 294.15\n}\n</action>\n```\n\nYour response must contain BOTH the `<think>` and `<action>` sections. Now, analyze the input you are given and generate your response.\n",
                "llm_input": "--- CONTEXT AND USER DEMAND ---\n```\n### 1. Dynamic State\nAt Month 02, Day 01, 00:00, the indoor temperature is 289.19K (16.04°C) while the outdoor temperature is 265.05K (-8.10°C). The fan is consuming 0W, and both heating and cooling are currently off. Lighting power is at 56.64W and plug load power is at 25.92W.\n\n### 2. Key Operational Rules\n* **Occupancy Schedule & Setpoints:** Occupied from 8am to 6pm. Setpoints when occupied are 21°C (Heating) and 24°C (Cooling). When unoccupied, they are 15°C (Heating) and 30°C (Cooling).\n* **Building Thermal Characteristics:** The building has a multi-layered envelope with varying thermal properties for walls, roof, and floors.\n* **HVAC System:** Not specified.\n\n### 3. Available Controls\n* `con_oveTSetCoo_activate`: Cooling setpoint override activation, range [0.0, 1.0].\n* `con_oveTSetCoo_u`: Cooling setpoint override, range [278.15K, 308.15K].\n* `con_oveTSetHea_activate`: Heating setpoint override activation, range [0.0, 1.0].\n* `con_oveTSetHea_u`: Heating setpoint override, range [278.15K, 308.15K].\n* `fcu_oveFan_activate`: Fan control activation, range [0.0, 1.0].\n* `fcu_oveFan_u`: Fan control signal, range [0.0, 1.0].\n* `fcu_oveTSup_activate`: Supply air temperature setpoint activation, range [0.0, 1.0].\n* `fcu_oveTSup_u`: Supply air temperature setpoint, range [285.15K, 313.15K].\n```\n\nUser's primary goal: The controllable parameter is con_oveTSetHea_u in the range ‘min_value’: 278.15, ‘max_value’: 308.15, “unit”: ‘K’.The primary goal is to minimize energy consumption while strictly ensuring that thermal comfort conditions are maintained within an acceptable range.\n\n--- FEEDBACK ON YOUR LAST ACTION ---\nYour previous action resulted in a reward of: 0.0000.\nA higher reward is better. If the reward is negative, you must analyze why and adjust your strategy.",
                "llm_thought": "The current indoor temperature is 289.19K (16.04°C), which is below the occupied heating setpoint of 21°C (294.15K) and the unoccupied heating setpoint of 15°C (288.15K). Since it is currently 00:00, the building is unoccupied, and the indoor temperature is within the unoccupied setpoint range (15°C to 30°C). \n\nThe user's primary goal is to minimize energy consumption while maintaining thermal comfort. Given that the current temperature is within the acceptable unoccupied range, no heating is needed at this time. The previous action resulted in a neutral reward (0.0000), indicating that the action neither improved nor worsened the situation. \n\nTo minimize energy consumption, I should avoid activating the heating system when the temperature is within the acceptable range. Therefore, I will keep the heating setpoint at the lower end of the unoccupied range (15°C or 288.15K) to ensure no unnecessary heating is triggered. This approach aligns with the goal of energy savings while maintaining comfort conditions.",
