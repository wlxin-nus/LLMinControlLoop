Given the lightweight construction of the building, heat transfer will be relatively rapid compared to heavyweight structures.\n\nWith energy consumption at 0W and no active HVAC operation, the system is currently in an optimal state for energy efficiency. The stable indoor temperature suggests that the building is in thermal equilibrium with its environment under current conditions. \n\nPredicting forward, the slight expected decrease in outdoor temperature to below 286.45K will enhance the natural cooling effect.

Any control action would introduce unnecessary energy cost and slew rate penalty without improving comfort. This aligns perfectly with the weighted optimization goals where energy cost has a 100x higher priority than comfort.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to maintain the current passive state, leveraging the natural cooling potential of the outdoor environment.\n</think>\n\n<action>\n{\"fcu_oveFan_u\": 0.0}\n</action>\n```"}

While still within the occupied cooling setpoint of 24\u00b0C, this downward trend suggests the building is gradually losing heat to the cooler outdoor environment (286.19K/13.04\u00b0C). Given the lightweight construction, this cooling rate is expected and will likely continue as outdoor temperatures are predicted to decrease further.\n\nThe current 0W energy consumption state is optimal from an energy cost perspective, but we must consider whether this passive cooling will eventually lead to discomfort. At the current cooling rate of ~0.11K/15min, it would take approximately 1.5 hours to reach the 24\u00b0C setpoint boundary. However, the outdoor temperature's continued decline may accelerate this cooling.\n\nThe key trade-off here is between maintaining zero energy use versus potentially allowing the temperature to drift below the cooling setpoint. Given the high weight (100x) on energy cost versus discomfort (1x), and the fact we're still 0.65\u00b0C above the setpoint, the optimal strategy remains passive operation. The slight negative reward (-0.0000) suggests our previous inaction was nearly optimal, with only negligible room for improvement.\n\nI recommend maintaining the current strategy of no mechanical cooling, as the natural cooling process is both energy-free and currently maintaining acceptable comfort levels.

The outdoor temperature at 285.96K (12.81\u00b0C) and its forecasted drop to 285.10K (11.95\u00b0C) creates an increasing temperature differential that will accelerate heat loss through the lightweight building envelope.\n\nAt the current cooling rate of approximately 0.22K/30min, we can project the temperature will reach the 24\u00b0C setpoint boundary within about 1 hour. However, with the outdoor temperature decreasing further, this crossover may occur sooner. The system remains in an optimal 0W energy state, but we're approaching the threshold where passive cooling might lead to discomfort.\n\nGiven the optimization weights (Energy Cost: 100, Discomfort: 1), the mathematically optimal decision remains passive operation until we actually reach the setpoint boundary. The negative reward (-0.0000) from the last action was negligible, confirming this approach remains valid. The key insight is that in this lightweight building, the temperature will respond quickly to any corrective action once we do cross the setpoint, allowing us to safely delay intervention.\n\nThis strategy consciously accepts a minimal, temporary discomfort penalty (weight=1) to maintain perfect energy efficiency (weight=100).
